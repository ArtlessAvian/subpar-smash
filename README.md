# subpar-smash

"Subpar Smash Brothers" is a hobby project. Don't expect much.  
As such, little effort has been put into creating the assets. This eventually will be polished, assuming this actually takes off.

If you would like to help, feel free to submit issues and pull requests.  
However, be descriptive in issues, and have reasonable code in pull requests.

This uses LibGDX; LibGDX is impressive and very legitimate, unlike this project.

### Current Goals
* Have level collision using line segments
* Have Hitboxes/Hurtboxes and a system to handle them
* Have at least two distinct characters
    * Physics Properties (Fall speed, Jump height, ect)
    * Sprites
    * Movesets
    * Character specific states
* And more!
